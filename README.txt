   Feel free to clone it in the future where I should have 2D collisions, 2D object collison boxes, 2D and 2.5D animations and the animation designer, 2D Skeleton format, Playing a recorded animation, making a fast animation file, 2D physics, 2D damage manager(probably some sort of dual "boolean" and "int" matrix marking the damage to apply damage to enemies on an arrea), 2D effects manager ("its own thread"?, if not process, fix frame rate and get deeper into OpenGL), 2D - 3D level design working smoothly, AI manager, AI spawner, Modules doing message passing maybe ?? on player touch ground object cancell physics, on player move check player for damage, AI damage manager (check one by one if AI is withing the damage matrix) ... I plan to have it first be a game engine for the type of game I want to make then making a game with it.
